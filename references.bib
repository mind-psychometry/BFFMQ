  abstract = {The authors examine the facet structure of mindfulness using five recently developed mindfulness questionnaires. Two large samples of undergraduate students completed mindfulness questionnaires and measures of other constructs. Psychometric properties of the mindfulness questionnaires were examined, including internal consistency and convergent and discriminant relationships with other variables. Factor analyses of the combined pool of items from the mindfulness questionnaires suggested that collectively they contain five clear, interpretable facets of mindfulness. Hierarchical confirmatory factor analyses suggested that at least four of the identified factors are components of an overall mindfulness construct and that the factor structure of mindfulness may vary with meditation experience. Mindfulness facets were shown to be differentially correlated in expected ways with several other constructs and to have incremental validity in the prediction of psychological symptoms. Findings suggest that conceptualizing mindfulness as a multifaceted construct is helpful in understanding its components and its relationships with other variables.},

  abstract = {Mindfulness is an attribute of consciousness long believed to promote well-being. This research provides a theoretical and empirical examination of the role of mindfulness in psychological well-being. The development and psychometric properties of the dispositional Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) are described. Correlational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory studies then show that the MAAS measures a unique quality of consciousness that is related to a variety of well-being constructs, that differentiates mindfulness practitioners from others, and that is associated with enhanced self-awareness. An experience-sampling study shows that both dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states. Finally, a clinical intervention study with cancer patients demonstrates that increases in mindfulness over time relate to declines in mood disturbance and stress.},

  abstract = {The extent to which locus of control beliefs influence reported physical illness may depend on the moderating effects of neuroticism and Stressors. In a test of this theory, 173 community-dwelling 35–55 year-old men and women completed self-report questionnaires assessing general locus of control, neuroticism, stressors, coping behaviors, and a symptom-free illness scale. Results showed that external locus of control was associated with high levels of neuroticism, experiencing many stressors, using more emotion-directed and fewer problem-directed coping behaviors, and experiencing high levels of perceived stress. Cross validation hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that the strongest predictor of reported illness was a complex interaction term of nonlinear neuroticism, nonlinear locus of control, and stressors. The main effect of stressors added further independent variance to the illness prediction. There appears to be a reliable influence on illness of extremely external locus of control beliefs, high levels of neuroticism that is independent of symptoms that overlap with illness, and stressors.},
